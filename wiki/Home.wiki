#summary MOD Home page

= Introduction =

Mobile On Desktop (MOD) is born from a lake of simple tools for WebApp Developpers.
Until now the only tools we have was :
    * Real emulators (iPhone, Android) which are slow and need powerfull computers
    * Web Browsers

MOD is a tool based on Qt and Webkit to test WebApp in pseudo-real context.

= Installation =

You can install MOD only from sources. Go to the download page or use Subversion. 

I'm working on a Windows installer. I don't own a Macintosh, I can't offer a 
MacOS X installer. Any volonteer ?
